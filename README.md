# VitaminSHE

Our project is VitaminSHE, a web app that aims to help improve women's health, health care, and well-being through vitamin intake worldwide. The inspiration for this web application stems from how personally this topic resonates with the team members of VitaminSHE. Our team is an all womenâ€™s team and  have either personally experienced or spoken to other females within our own communities  the consequences of a vitamin or mineral deficiency. 

VitaminShe has three processes. Firstly it helps women know their daily vitamin and mineral intake. Secondly, we provide food recommendations for each category of essential vitamins and minerals. Lastly, we have a feature that will allow individuals to find a nearby clinic to get a blood check-up to have a clear idea about their Vitamin levels.
